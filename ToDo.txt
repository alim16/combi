1: change listener to establish a single ssh session (establish a new session for each call 
is really slow)

2: change listener to pass the value entered in the form field to the stepper motor script
and update the motor script to set the max spin value to match what was passed in by the listener

3: add validation to input field (max 1000 and min > 0), using incomplete reducer
